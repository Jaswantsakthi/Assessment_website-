# Demo Website
This demo site has been designed as a component of the Persist Ventures assessment. The site revolves around the concept of community services, providing a platform that is informative and entertaining for users. It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface with an emphasis on accessibility and smooth navigation.

In order to make this site come alive, I used the React.js library to develop the front-end layer. React.js is a robust JavaScript library that enables building dynamic and responsive user interfaces, and thus it was the perfect fit for this project. The site takes advantage of the flexibilities and modularity of React components so as to be able to scale and maintain it with ease.

For scripting and functionality, I used JavaScript, which facilitates seamless interaction among components and dynamic content rendering. The site has interactive elements that enrich the user experience and provide an effective flow of information.

The styling and structure of the website have been executed with HTML for structure and Tailwind CSS for styling. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables you to build UI very fast and in a customizable way. Through the use of this framework, I was able to design a great-looking and responsive design with a clean and structured code.

The website includes the following pages:

Home Page: The home page is the welcome page for the website and contains a general description of community services provided. It features notable aspects and allows for simple access to other pages of the site.

Events Page: The page shows future events in the community, giving the user information regarding event names, dates, and venues. It is easy for users to view the list of events and acquire information on how to join.

About Page: The about page presents users with in-depth information of the mission, vision, and the underlying principles of the values behind the community services. The about page provides an informative piece to inform viewers of the organization's purpose for the website as well as activities undertaken in the community.

The website, along with these staple pages, possesses several features necessary for a convenient experience. The features include:

Responsive Design: The site is completely responsive to ensure that it functions optimally on all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

Navigation and User Interaction: Navigation is straightforward and easy to use, allowing users to easily locate the information they seek. The site also features interactive elements like buttons and links to increase user interaction.

Contemporary UI/UX: The user interface is created with consideration for user experience. The structure is simple and visually pleasing, with smooth movement and minimalist design decisions that correlate with the concept of community services.

Accessibility: I have taken care to ensure that the site is accessible for all users, including people with disabilities. Inclusions such as alt text on images and good semantic HTML are made to align with web accessibility guidelines.

In total, this demo site demonstrates my capacity to integrate design, functionality, and user experience into a harmonious platform. It is a reflection of my proficiency in front-end web development, especially in using React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS to create a fully functional and visually appealing website.
