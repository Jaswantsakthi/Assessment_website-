# Demo Website
This demo website has been developed as part of the assessment conducted by Persist Ventures. The website is centered around the theme of community services, offering a platform that is both informative and engaging for users. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, focusing on accessibility and seamless navigation.

To bring this website to life, I utilized the React.js library to create the front-end layer. React.js is a powerful JavaScript library that allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces, making it ideal for this project. The website leverages the flexibility and modularity of React components to ensure scalability and ease of maintenance.

For the scripting and functionality, I employed JavaScript, which enables smooth interaction between components and dynamic content rendering. The website includes interactive features that enhance the user experience and ensure an efficient flow of information.

The design and layout of the website have been implemented using HTML for the structure and Tailwind CSS for styling. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and customizable UI development. By using this framework, I was able to create a visually appealing and responsive design while maintaining a clean and organized code structure.

The website consists of the following pages:

Home Page: The homepage serves as the introduction to the website and includes a brief overview of the community services offered. It highlights key features and provides easy navigation to other sections of the website.

Events Page: This page displays upcoming community events, providing users with details such as event names, dates, and locations. Users can easily browse through the list of events and get information about how to participate.

About Page: The about page gives users a detailed insight into the organization's mission, vision, and the core values behind the community services. It serves as an informative section to help visitors understand the purpose of the website and the work being done in the community.

In addition to these core pages, the website includes various features that are crucial for a seamless experience. These features include:

Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring it works efficiently across all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

Navigation and User Interaction: The navigation is simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to find the information they need. The website also includes interactive elements such as buttons and links to enhance user engagement.

Modern UI/UX: The user interface has been designed with a focus on user experience. The layout is clean and visually appealing, with smooth transitions and minimalistic design choices that align with the theme of community services.

Accessibility: I have ensured that the website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Features like alt text for images and proper semantic HTML are included to comply with web accessibility standards.

Overall, this demo website showcases my ability to combine design, functionality, and user experience into a seamless platform. It serves as a testament to my skills in front-end web development, particularly in utilizing React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS to build a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing website.
